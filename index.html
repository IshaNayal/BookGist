                        sixteen-year-old girl living with thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Hazel lives a
                        quiet life, often alone with her thoughts and her favorite novel, until she meets Augustus
                        Waters at a cancer support group. Augustus is witty, charming, and determined to live life to
                        the fullest despite having lost a leg to osteosarcoma. The two quickly form a deep connection,
                        sharing jokes, philosophical conversations, and a love of books. Their bond leads them on an
                        extraordinary trip to Amsterdam, where they hope to find answers from Hazel’s reclusive favorite
                        author. But as they fall in love, they’re forced to confront the brutal realities of illness and
                        the fragility of life. Both heartbreaking and filled with moments of humor and warmth, The Fault
                        in Our Stars explores love, mortality, and what it means to leave a mark on the world. It’s a
                        deeply emotional story that will make you laugh, cry, and think about life in a whole new way.

                        “It Ends With Us” by Colleen Hoover is an unforgettable, deeply moving novel that blends romance
                        with raw emotional truth. The story follows Lily Bloom, a young woman who has worked hard to
                        build the life she wants, leaving behind a difficult childhood in Maine. In Boston, she meets
                        Ryle Kincaid, a brilliant and assertive neurosurgeon who seems perfect—except for his aversion
                        to relationships. As Lily falls deeper into Ryle’s world, her first love, Atlas Corrigan,
                        reappears, bringing back memories of a past that shaped her and challenging everything she
                        thought she knew about love and loyalty.

                        This is not just a love story—it’s a poignant exploration of the complexities of domestic abuse,
                        resilience, and the painful choices we make to protect ourselves and those we love. With
                        Hoover’s gripping storytelling and heartfelt characters, “It Ends With Us” will keep you turning
                        pages late into the night—and leave you thinking about it long after the last sentence.
